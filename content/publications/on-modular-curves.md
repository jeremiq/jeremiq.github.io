We describe the Langlands-Kottwitz method for counting points mod p of
Shimura varieties at places of good reduction in the special case of
the modular curve. We then explicit the calculation of the semisimple
trace of Frobenius on the nearby cycles sheaves, following the recent
work of Peter Scholze. This effectively extends the Langlands-Kottwitz approach to all places.
